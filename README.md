## What is a metaform?

Metaform is an open library for working with the Anilibria REST API. Reincarnation and reinterpretation of the outdated XConnect project.

## ⚠️ Risks when using the `alpha` version

The metaform is at an early stage of development and has an unstable API, so it is highly not recommended for writing real projects. I advise you to wait for the first stable release.
